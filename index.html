            <h2>
                Chess was Invented around the Sixth Century and was called "chaturanga" in it's earliest form. <br> <br>
                Each piece moves in a unique way  
                <ul>
                    <li>The king may move in any direction once</li>
                    <li>the queen moves any number of squares in any direction</li>
                    <li>the bishop moves any number of squares diagonally (from one corner to the next)</li>
                    <li>the knight is an odd one, going into an "L" shape two squares one way and a perpendcular way as well, (a ninety degree angle)</li>
                    <li>the Rook can go any number of squares going left or right and upor down.</li>
                    <li>Lastly the pawn, moving one square forward or two squares from the pieces starting position</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>The way you claim other pieces are simple: simply move to a square that is taken by an enemy piece and it will be "captured" which takes it off the board.</p>
