            Each piece moves in a unique way  
                <ul>
                    <li>The king may move in any direction once</li>
                    <li>the queen moves any number of squares in any direction</li>
                    <li>the bishop moves any number of squares diagonally (from one corner to the next)</li>
                    <li>the knight is an odd one, going into an "L" shape two squares one way and a perpendcular way as well, (a ninety degree angle)</li>
                    <li>the Rook can go any number of squares going left or right and upor down.</li>
                    <li>Lastly the pawn, moving one square forward or two squares from the pieces starting position</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>The way you claim other pieces are simple: simply move to a square that is taken by an enemy piece and it will be "captured" which takes it off the board.
                    In order to win the game you need to captue your opponents King Piece which can be done directly or by checkmate.
